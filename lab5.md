Lab Reflection:

The coolest thing I learned was how to use the vim command. I already knew about nano, which is simpler, but vim turned out to be really interesting. Vim lets you do a lot of stuff quickly just using the keyboard, without needing a mouse. This can make working on code or editing text much faster once you get used to it.

What's cool about vim is all the different keyboard shortcuts it has. For example, you can use dd to delete a line, yy to copy a line, and p to paste it somewhere else. These shortcuts make changing text super quick and easy. Jumping to the start or end of a file is simple too. At first, vim seemed a bit tricky, but after some practice, it's actually really handy and fun to use.
